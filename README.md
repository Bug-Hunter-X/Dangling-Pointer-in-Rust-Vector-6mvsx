This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving dangling pointers and vectors. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code. The solution in `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer way to access and modify vector elements that avoids the risks associated with raw pointers.  The issue stems from using `as_mut_ptr()` to obtain a raw pointer to the vector's data and then modifying it after the vector's lifetime ends. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes. The solution avoids this by using safe methods provided by the standard library.
